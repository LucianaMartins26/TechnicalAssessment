[pipeline.py](src/pipeline.py) is the script that run the FileDownloader and FileProcessing classes automatically.
FileProcessing is not completely functional since it only returns a csv with the correct header and not with data extracted from the xml.

UniTesting is performed, and it can be found in [Tests](tests) folder.
